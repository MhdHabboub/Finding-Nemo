# Artificial Intelligence Finds Nemo: A Visual Guide to Particle Swarm Optimization

## Introduction

Welcome to our captivating [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/2yKI3wKOWyc).
In this repository, we explore the fascinating world of Artificial Swarm Intelligence by using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to search for Nemo, the iconic clownfish, in the vast ocean. The provided Python code implements the PSO algorithm and visually demonstrates its search process through an animation.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you'll need a basic understanding of Python programming and probability concepts.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine and ensure you have Python (version x.x) installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MhdHabboub/Finding-Nemo
```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script using the command:

```bash
python ai_finds_nemo.py
```

## Code Explanation

The `ai_finds_nemo.py` script implements the PSO algorithm to search for the optimal location in a simulated ocean depth landscape. The main steps of the code include:

1. Defining constants and parameters.
2. Initializing particles and their velocities.
3. Updating particle velocities based on cognitive and social influences.
4. Updating particle positions.
5. Updating personal best positions and global best position.
6. Creating visualizations to illustrate the search process.
